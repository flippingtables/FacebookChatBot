Dont always jump where
the fence is lowest
Does the bear
shit in the woods
all men are born
equal
the grass is greenest
on the other side
As sure as the sky is blue
the world is good
Don't cry because it's over
smile because it happened
But if you can't handle me at my worst
then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best
Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter
and those who matter don't mind
Be yourself
everyone else is already taken
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity;
and I'm not sure about the universe
You only live once, but if you do it right,
once is enough
Be the change that you wish to see
in the world
A room without books is like
a body without a soul
So many books
so little time
In three words I can sum up everything
I've learned about life: it goes on
No one can make you feel inferior without your
consent
A friend is someone who knows all about you and
still loves you
Always forgive your enemies;
nothing annoys them so much
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to
live forever
I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am
saying
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you
made them feel
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can
Without music, life would be
a mistake
To live is the rarest thing in the world.
Most people exist, that is all.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is
the greatest accomplishment
Friendship often ends in love;
but love in friendship - never
Art is a step from what is obvious and well-known toward what is
arcane and concealed
Talent does what it can;
genius does what it must
Strive not to be a success,
but rather to be of value
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, 
and that has made all the difference
Every strike brings me closer to 
the next home run
Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of 
all achievement
Life is 10% what happens to me
and 90% of how I react to it
Whatever the mind of man can conceive
and believe, it can achieve
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it
living someone else’s life
Strive not to be a success,
but rather to be of value
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, 
and that has made all the difference.
The common question that gets asked in business is, ‘why?’ That’s a good question, but 
an equally valid question is, ‘why not?’
You miss 100% of the shots you don’t
take
Every strike brings me closer to
the next home run
Definiteness of purpose is
the starting point of all achievement
Life is what happens to you while you’re 
busy making other plans
We become
what we think about
An unexamined life is not worth living. –Socrates
Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to 
win is
Once you choose hope
anything’s possible
Mistakes are the portals of
discovery
Do not be afraid to ask dumb questions; they are easier to handle than
dumb mistakes
Never forget
what a person says to you when they are angry
Once we accept our limits,
we go beyond them
A best friend is like
a four leaf clover, hard to find, lucky to have
The richest man is not he who has the most, but he who
needs the least.
You must be the change
you wish to see in the world
